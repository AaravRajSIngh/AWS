Question 1: 
You are developing a new batch job for the enterprise application suite in your company, which is hosted in an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances behind an ELB. The application is using an S3 bucket configured with Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS). The batch job must upload files to the bucket using the default AWS KMS key to protect the data at rest.

What should you do to satisfy this requirement with the LEAST amount of configuration?
